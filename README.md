# Language identification using machine learning

This repository contains the machine learning model for detecting the language of the given text.

The dataset is taken from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/zarajamshaid/language-identification-datasst).

We have used scikit learn library to build the models, train it and test it along with numpy and pandas. 

Steps for making the model:

1. Importing the required libraries.

2. Loading the dataset.

3. Data preprocessing - checking for nulls, duplicates, transforming text to lower case, etc.

4. Splitting into training and testing data

5. Training the model on train data.

6. Testing the model on test data.

7. Evaluating the model.
